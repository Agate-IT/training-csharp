# Welcome to Agate-IT C# training!

Hi, the goal of this repository is to help you review your C#/ .NET knowledge and improve it. You will find different sections from the basic to advanced C# topics. 
We've also included important knowledge with exercices for clean code, SOLID, design partterns as well as training for TDD, BDD, etc.
Last but not least, this is certainly not the most complete repository for C# training. Please feel free to enrich it and let's make it awesome together :)
